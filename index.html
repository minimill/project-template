<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>The following image is both progressive (loads with a placeholder) and responisve (loads the correcet image size depending on screen resolution). If all you dont' see an image below, make sure that you run <code>gulp responsive</code> to generate the different image versions. This must be done whenever you add new images (resizing images when you run <code>gulp serve</code> would be extremely slow).</p>

<div style="max-width: 500px">
    {% include resimg.html src="example-image.jpg" class="with-viewer" %}
</div>
