Project Template
========================================

#### _Because web development doesn't need to be a pain._

The [Minimill](https://minimill.co) project template is the best way to build static sites fast.  With one command, build a static page using [Gulp][gulp], [Jekyll][jekyll], and [SCSS][scss].

_Other Versions: [ES6](https://github.com/minimill/project-template/tree/es6), [Minimill internal](https://github.com/minimill/project-template/tree/minimill)_

## Features

- Install the project in just three commands (see "Developing" below).
- Use [Jekyll][jekyll] for content management and templating.
- Use [ImageMagick][imagemagick] to resize images for responsive / retina loading.
- Use [SCSS][scss] to keep our CSS organized into logical components.
- Use [Autoprefixer][autoprefixer] to automatically insert browser prefixes where necessary to handle cross browser compatibility.
- Use [Browsersync][browsersync] to automatically launch a development version of our website, reload the page whenever we change the HTML, and inject changes to CSS, JavaScript, and images with needing to reload.
- Use [HTML Minifier][htmlmin], [CSSNano][cssnano], [UglifyJS][uglifyjs], and [ImageMin][imagemin] to compress and optimize our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, respectively.
- Use [SCSS-Lint][scss-lint], [JSHint][jshint], and [JSCS][jscs] to perform [linting][linting] and style checking on our SCSS and JavaScript files.

All with one command from the terminal:

```bash
gulp serve
```

## Setup

Install [npm][npm-install]. Then, install gulp:

```bash
npm install -g gulp  # May require `sudo`
```

Finally, install [ImageMagick][imagemagick]. You have done so successfully if you can run 

```bash
convert -help
```

 without any errors.

## Usage

### Developing

```bash
npm install            # One time
gem install scss_lint  # One time
gulp serve
```

### A Note on Directory Structure and Compilation

Because Gulp and Jekyll to not play nice historically, static assets need to be generated into two different folders:

* SCSS source files live in `_scss/` and compile to both  `css/` and `_site/css/` 
* JavaScript source files live in `_js/` and compile to both  `js/` and `_site/js/`
* Images in `_img/` compile to both  `img/` and `_site/img/`

> **Note:** the root level `css/`, `js/`, and `img/` folders are in the `.gitignore` and are regularly deleted.  **Modifications to these folders may be lost without warning!** Instead, edit source files in the corresponding underscore-prefixed folders.

### Responsive Images


Responsive images live in the `/_img/res` folder. Place images that you wish to resize into the `/_img/res/raw` folder.  To resize them, run

```bash
gulp responsive
```

This will create subdirectories within the `/_img/res/` folder with resized images in each.  By default, it creates the folders `20/`, `200/`, `800/`, and `1600/`, with images resized to those heights in pixels in each one. Then, these images will be copied into `/_site/img/res/<size>` for static access. 

For example, if `/_img/res/raw/test.png` has resolution 5120x3200, running `gulp responsive` will create a 32x20px image at `/_img/res/20/test.png`, a 320x200px image at `/_img/res/200/test.png`, etc. After running `gulp serve`, those files will be available statically at `/img/res/<size>/test.png`.

You can customize what size images are generated by changing the `responsiveSizes` variable at the top of `Gulpfile.js`.

> **Note:** By default, responsive resizing is not included in the `gulp serve` command, as it can be very computationally expensive. This can be enabled by uncommenting `['responsive']` in the `images` and `images:optimized` tasks.

## Reminders

If you want to use this repo for your next project, make sure to make the following changes:

1. Edit `_config.yml`, filling in the HTML metadata associated with your site.
2. Edit `package.json` providing a `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, and `repository.url`.
3. Remove the `.git` folder, so that you start from a fresh commit history.
4. Edit `LICENSE.md` and `README.md` to your preference.

## Gulp Commands

An overview of Gulp commands available:

### `gulp build`

Builds the site into the `dist` directory.  This includes:

- SCSS w/ linting, sourcemaps and autoprefixing
- JS linting and uglification
- Image optimization and resizing

### `gulp build:optimized`

This is used for distributing an optimized version of the site (for deployment).  It includes everything from `gulp build` as well as:
- SCSS minification
- CSS / JS inline-sourcing 
- more rigorous image optimization

### `gulp responsive`

Resizes images in the `_img/res/raw` directory into `_img/res/<size>` directories, for several different heights in pixels (default: 20, 200, 800, 1600).

### `gulp watch`

Watchs for changes in local files and rebuilds parts of the site as necessary, into the `dist` directory.

### `gulp serve`

Runs `gulp watch` in the background, and serves the `dist` directory at `localhost:3000` with automatic reloading using [Browsersync][browsersync].
